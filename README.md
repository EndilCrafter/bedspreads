# Bedspreads

Bedspreads is a mod that allows players to add banner patterns to their beds, kind of like what they can already do with
shields. This is done simply by crafting a bed with the desired banner. The banner pattern will encompass the entire bed,
so the color of the bed doesn't really matter as much as the color of the banner when they're combined.

## Features

### Recipe

The recipe to craft a decorated bed is to simple place a vanilla bed and a banner of any pattern into a crafting grid in
any shape.

In addition, players can separate them again by crafting the decorated bed by itself. This will yield the original banner
used and will leave the original bed used in the crafting grid.

## Developing

**Help! I'm getting Mixin crashes when I try to launch in development on Forge!**

Bedspreads uses Mixins to implement its core features. This may cause issues when depending on
Bedspreads for your project inside a development environment since ForgeGradle/MixinGradle do not yet
support this natively like on the Fabric toolchain. As a workaround, please disable the refmaps in
development by setting the `mixin.env.disableRefMap` JVM argument to `true` in your run
configuration.
